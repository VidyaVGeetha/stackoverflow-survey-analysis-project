# Developer Survey Data Analysis

This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing a developer survey dataset.  
The goal is to practice real-world data-analysis skills such as handling missing values,
feature engineering, exploratory analysis, visualization, and insight reporting.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess survey data
- Handle missing values and inconsistent categories
- Convert text-based fields into numeric values
- Analyze trends in:
  - Experience vs Job Satisfaction
  - Remote Work Preferences
  - Education Level vs Employment Type
  - Programming Language Usage by Region
- Export cleaned datasets for reuse
